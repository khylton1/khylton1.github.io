Introduction + Background:
======
When it comes to the basic needs of human beings, housing is at the top of the list. Every person deserves access to safe housing, clean air to breath, and nutritious food yet in Maryland and all across the country many people struggle to obtain these basic necessities. This semester, specifically in the class I am taking with Professor Dawn Biehler and in other GES courses, we have been discussing the implications of housing, air quality, and food insecurity on the health of individuals. When creating these maps, my goal was to demonstrate how housing, specifically evictions, can negatively impact human health. According to data collected in 2016, across the United States 6.1 percent of renter households have been served eviction notices and 2.3 percent of those households were evicted from their homes. (Desmond, Himmelstein 2021)
While the threat of eviction may be the first worry that comes to mind, there are many other possible side effects that are just as worrying. Many studies have found that there is a direct link between eviction and adverse birth outcomes, including lower birth weights, prematurity, and infant mortality (Desmond, Himmelstein 2021)

Data + Methods: 
======
For each map I created, I used data from Maryland’s GIS Data Catalog. I downloaded four shapefiles from the website. The first being data collected in 2012 on the number of infant deaths in Maryland per county. The second shapefile was data collected from 2010-2012 representing the all-cause mortality rate in Maryland by county. The third shapefile I downloaded was data using census tracts to categorize areas in Maryland as either “Communities of Opportunity” or “Not a Community of Opportunity”. The last shapefile I downloaded was data based on census tracts representing housing areas in Maryland that qualify (Qualified Census Tracts) for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program. I used QGIS to manipulate each shapefile I downloaded to display the specific data I wanted. I categorized each data set and selected the specific value I wanted to be displayed on each map. Then I went ahead and classified the values so they would be broken down by number or by “YES” “NO” depending on the data set to be better displayed on the map. I selected the color ramps specifically for each map to correctly display the data. I made sure that for the maps displaying continuous variables I used a color gradient rather than random colors to represent the disparities amongst the data, whereas for the discrete variables two colors were displayed, one representing “YES” the other representing “NO”.  Finally, I created layouts for each map placing a title, legend, north arrow, and scale bar for the viewers understanding. 

Analysis + Results:
======
When looking at the results displayed on the maps, there are many commonalities that are rather concerning. When looking at the map displaying the number of infant mortality in Maryland by county it is quite apparent that there are two areas with the highest numbers. The county with the highest number of infant mortalities is Prince George’s County at 103 infant deaths recorded in 2012, Baltimore City follows in second at 88 infant deaths recorded in 2012. These higher than average infant death counts aren’t just due to Prince George’s County and Baltimore City being more populous than the rest of Maryland either. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau in 2012, Baltimore City and Prince George’s County had the highest infant mortality rates in Maryland, with Baltimore City having the highest at 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012 and Prince George's County having the second highest at 8.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012. When looking at the map displaying the all-cause mortality rates in Maryland by county Baltimore City it is the area with the highest rate coming in at 984 deaths per 100,000. 
When looking at the map displaying areas in Maryland categorized as either “Communities of Opportunity” or “Not a Community of Opportunity” there are many similarities to the first two maps described above. Many of the census tracts that are not considered communities of opportunity are located in Baltimore City and Prince George’s County. Lastly, when looking at the map I created representing housing areas in Maryland based on census tracts that qualify for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program there is once again a distinct pattern in the displayed data. The map displays “Targeted Areas in Maryland” to primarily be located in Baltimore and Prince George’s County, with a few scattered areas located in Montgomery County, Washington County, and Somerset County. Baltimore City also had the highest poverty rate in Maryland with an estimated poverty rate of 23.4 percent (Maryland Manual On-Line, 2022). 

Conclusion: 
======
Over all these graphs can further support the data that the threat of eviction and the stress that is causes can drasticlly imapct the health of tenets. Studies have found a direct corrilation beteen evicion and all-cause mortality rates (Rojas, 2017). According to the National Cancer Institute all-cause mortality can be defined as: “A term that refers to death from any cause. In statistics, all-cause mortality is usually a measure of the total number of deaths from any cause in a specific group of people over a specific period of time. For example, all-cause mortality may be reported for people who live in one area of the country or who are of a specific gender, age, race, or ethnic group.”
 My findings displayed in the maps I created for this project further corroborate the idea that not only is eviction directly related to high poverty rates in Maryland but areas with said high poverty rates have a direct impact on the health of those residents.
